This Code shows how you can create a VPC and add a subnet to that VPC, then make the subnet public so that it can be accessed by the Internet,
It also shows how to connect the VPC to a route table and an IGW using the resource "aws_route_table_association"

Explanation
Internet Gateway: The aws_internet_gateway resource creates an IGW and attaches it to the VPC.

Route Table: The aws_route_table resource creates a route table and defines a route (0.0.0.0/0) that directs all outbound traffic to the IGW.

Route Table Association: The aws_route_table_association resource associates the route table with the subnet, making the subnet a public subnet.
